- 👋 Hi, I’m Erika, I have an accounting background and is currently at the beginning stage of transitioning to having a more science-based approach in handling data
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming, data analytics, and data science
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for Google Data Analytics Certification which will hopefully help me with my MS data science post-graduate studies soon   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that would improve my coding and data analytics skills
